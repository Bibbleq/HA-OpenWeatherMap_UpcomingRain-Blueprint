Fixes the error: `can't access property \"get_minute_forecast\", t.services[e] is undefined`\n\n## Changes\n- Changed service call from `weather_provider.get_minute_forecast` to `openweathermap.get_minute_forecast` (line 83)\n- Updated blueprint title to specify OpenWeatherMap\n- Added `integration: openweathermap` to weather entity selector for better UX\n\n## Why\nThe generic service name `weather_provider.get_minute_forecast` doesn't exist in Home Assistant. The correct service for OpenWeatherMap integration is `openweathermap.get_minute_forecast`.\n\nThis resolves the error where the automation couldn't find the service.
